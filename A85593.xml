            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ON the 13. of this inſtant (after a tempeſtuous ſtorm) it pleaſed God to admit us a fair Gale, and a ſeaſonable calm, untill ſuch time that we had coaſted neer the point of <hi>Gibralterre,</hi> where we made a diſcovery of the reſt of our Fleet under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Vice-Admirall <hi>Pen;</hi> and coming up to them, our Captain was called aboard the <hi>Fairfax</hi> Frigat, where a Councel of Officers were preſent; and after ſome ſerious conſultation touchin the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> Fleet in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166006:3"/>
                     <hi>Streights,</hi> unanimouſly reſolved to ſteer towards that coaſt, and fight them; and accordingly on the 14 inſtant, we weighed anchor, and after 9 hours ſayl came within ſight of them; which they perceiving, immediatly prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Us, opening their port-holes, put forth their Guns, and man'd their Decks; for indeed they were at leaſt three to one; being about 33 Sayl, and moſt conſiſting of thoſe Bankers which were the onely Pyrats that had moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch:</hi> Our Fleet conſiſted of but nine ſayl, but very reſolved men; as appears by the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narrative, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we came within a league of their Rear. Admirall, Orders were given for each man to make ready to man the Decks, the Gunners and their Aſſiſtants to prepare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their port-holes; and ſo each man according to his place and calling, to endeavour what in him lay to perform that duty and ſervice which God had called him unto: This was with great care and prudence obſerved; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly the Red Flag in every ſhip was put forth; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the Trumpets ſounded, the Marriners ſhouted, and ſoon after the Canons plaid; for when we came within half a league of them, about 13 of their beſt ſhips were manned forth, who gave us ſeveral broad ſides; which Captain <hi>Pen</hi> perceiving, immediatly made up to them with the <hi>Fairfax,</hi> the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and the <hi>George,</hi> and gave them eight broad ſides; inſomuch that the Enemy decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned engagement, and would fain have deſerted us; but C. <hi>Pen</hi> keeping cloſe up with them to the reſt of their ſhips, the whole Fleets became engaged; and a bloudy fight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, which continued for the ſpace of two hours, and very gallantly maintained on both ſides: For the <hi>Lyon</hi> laid the <hi>French</hi> Admiral aboard three times, and was ſtill repulſed and beaten off; but the fourth time ſhe carryed it, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166006:3"/>hailing her cloſe, entred the ſhip, and put moſt of the men to the ſword, for they denied quarter. During this diſpute, the valiant <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the reſt of our Fleet, plyed them cloſe with great and ſmall ſhot, and killed many of them, eſpecially the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who lay the moſt open to out ſhot, for they charged their Canon on the out-ſide of their ſhips: In this conflict we ſunk 7, and boarded five more; and at laſt diſpierſed the whole Navy, taking about 15 ſayl of them; ſo that there are not many got off, but ſome few <hi>Pickroons,</hi> which were too ſwift for us; but I am confident, they cannot be very ſerviceable; for the ſhips that we have taken are exceedingly torn, and moſt of the men either kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or wounded; ſo reſolutely did they fight it out. And truly I may ſay, that ſuch a mercy never did God beſtow upon his poor ſervants at Sea, as he hath done upon Us, in giving of Us Victory over our Enemies, and making Us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for the vanquiſhing ſuch a formidable pyrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power as theſe were, with ſo little loſſe; for from the beginning to the ending, we loſt not above 20 men, ſome few wounded, and our ſhips not much defaced or torn: God grant that we may live to praiſe &amp; glorifie the Name of the Lord for this happy deliverance: And likewiſe for the many and wonderful deliverances which He hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Two Dutch men of War came in to our aſſiſtance about the middle of the fight; but its conjectur'd, that it was more for their own ends, then for any love they bare to us: however, I ſhall cenſure charitably; for we have loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but they haue gain'd; having by this means inlarg'd their liberty upon theſe Coaſts.</p>
