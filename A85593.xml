            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ON the 13. of this in≈øtant (after a tempe≈øtuous ≈øtorm) it plea≈øed God to admit us a fair Gale, and a ≈øea≈øonable calm, untill ≈øuch time that we had coa≈øted neer the point of <hi>Gibralterre,</hi> where we made a di≈øcovery of the re≈øt of our Fleet under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Vice-Admirall <hi>Pen;</hi> and coming up to them, our Captain was called aboard the <hi>Fairfax</hi> Frigat, where a Councel of Officers were pre≈øent; and after ≈øome ≈øerious con≈øultation touchin the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> Fleet in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166006:3"/>
                     <hi>Streights,</hi> unanimou≈øly re≈øolved to ≈øteer towards that coa≈øt, and fight them; and accordingly on the 14 in≈øtant, we weighed anchor, and after 9 hours ≈øayl came within ≈øight of them; which they perceiving, immediatly prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Us, opening their port-holes, put forth their Guns, and man'd their Decks; for indeed they were at lea≈øt three to one; being about 33 Sayl, and mo≈øt con≈øi≈øting of tho≈øe Bankers which were the onely Pyrats that had mo≈øt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy'd the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> and <hi>Dutch:</hi> Our Fleet con≈øi≈øted of but nine ≈øayl, but very re≈øolved men; as appears by the en≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narrative, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we came within a league of their Rear. Admirall, Orders were given for each man to make ready to man the Decks, the Gunners and their A≈ø≈øi≈øtants to prepare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their port-holes; and ≈øo each man according to his place and calling, to endeavour what in him lay to perform that duty and ≈øervice which God had called him unto: This was with great care and prudence ob≈øerved; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly the Red Flag in every ≈øhip was put forth; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the Trumpets ≈øounded, the Marriners ≈øhouted, and ≈øoon after the Canons plaid; for when we came within half a league of them, about 13 of their be≈øt ≈øhips were manned forth, who gave us ≈øeveral broad ≈øides; which Captain <hi>Pen</hi> perceiving, immediatly made up to them with the <hi>Fairfax,</hi> the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and the <hi>George,</hi> and gave them eight broad ≈øides; in≈øomuch that the Enemy decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned engagement, and would fain have de≈øerted us; but C. <hi>Pen</hi> keeping clo≈øe up with them to the re≈øt of their ≈øhips, the whole Fleets became engaged; and a bloudy fight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued, which continued for the ≈øpace of two hours, and very gallantly maintained on both ≈øides: For the <hi>Lyon</hi> laid the <hi>French</hi> Admiral aboard three times, and was ≈øtill repul≈øed and beaten off; but the fourth time ≈øhe carryed it, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166006:3"/>hailing her clo≈øe, entred the ≈øhip, and put mo≈øt of the men to the ≈øword, for they denied quarter. During this di≈øpute, the valiant <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the re≈øt of our Fleet, plyed them clo≈øe with great and ≈ømall ≈øhot, and killed many of them, e≈øpecially the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who lay the mo≈øt open to out ≈øhot, for they charged their Canon on the out-≈øide of their ≈øhips: In this conflict we ≈øunk 7, and boarded five more; and at la≈øt di≈øpier≈øed the whole Navy, taking about 15 ≈øayl of them; ≈øo that there are not many got off, but ≈øome few <hi>Pickroons,</hi> which were too ≈øwift for us; but I am confident, they cannot be very ≈øerviceable; for the ≈øhips that we have taken are exceedingly torn, and mo≈øt of the men either kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or wounded; ≈øo re≈øolutely did they fight it out. And truly I may ≈øay, that ≈øuch a mercy never did God be≈øtow upon his poor ≈øervants at Sea, as he hath done upon Us, in giving of Us Victory over our Enemies, and making Us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrumental for the vanqui≈øhing ≈øuch a formidable pyrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power as the≈øe were, with ≈øo little lo≈ø≈øe; for from the beginning to the ending, we lo≈øt not above 20 men, ≈øome few wounded, and our ≈øhips not much defaced or torn: God grant that we may live to prai≈øe &amp; glorifie the Name of the Lord for this happy deliverance: And likewi≈øe for the many and wonderful deliverances which He hath di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øed to his ≈øervants.</p>
                  <p>Two Dutch men of War came in to our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance about the middle of the fight; but its conjectur'd, that it was more for their own ends, then for any love they bare to us: however, I ≈øhall cen≈øure charitably; for we have lo≈øt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but they haue gain'd; having by this means inlarg'd their liberty upon the≈øe Coa≈øts.</p>
